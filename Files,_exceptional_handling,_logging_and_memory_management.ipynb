        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?  \n",
        "**Answer:** The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception, while the `except` block catches and handles specific or general exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?  \n",
